# Career Transition Readiness & Bootcamp Reflections

## Readiness for Next Career Step

I feel **highly prepared** to take the next step in my career journey. The bootcamp has equipped me with both technical skills and the mindset needed to transition into a professional tech role. My confidence comes from:

- **Practical Project Experience**: Building full-stack applications from concept to deployment
- **Problem-Solving Muscle**: 400+ hours of coding challenges and debugging practice
- **Agile Methodology Fluency**: Experience working in sprint-based team projects
- **Portfolio Development**: 5+ production-ready projects demonstrating my capabilities

While I acknowledge there's always more to learn, I'm excited to apply my skills in a professional setting and grow through real-world challenges.
